# Changelog

Every release of this project, newest first. The admin panel reads this file to
show you what an update would bring before you install it.

Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **PATCH** — a fix. Nothing you do changes.
- **MINOR** — something new, or something behaves better than it did. Safe to
  take; nothing you have set up stops working.
- **MAJOR** — something you have to act on. A setting that has to move, a
  command that no longer exists, a manual step during the update. These say so
  at the top, in full, before anything else.

Updating never touches your database. Characters, accounts and settings survive
every version here.

## 1.3.4 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- The in-game helper no longer crashes the channel it runs on. It is still not
  installed by default — nobody has played on the fix yet.

---

## 1.3.3 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- The item search works in English and Turkish. It matched the whole box
  against German names, so "Full Moon Sword" found nothing while
  "Vollmondschwert" worked. It now matches word by word, translates the common
  ones, and ranks by how many words fit.

---

## 1.3.2 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- The in-game helper introduced in 1.3.0 disconnects the character it acts on.
  It is no longer installed. Items, yang and levels work as they did before
  1.3.0 — written to the account, visible at the next login — and teleport and
  running speed refuse instead of dropping the player.

**If you are on 1.3.0 or 1.3.1, update.** Until you do, avoid the buttons on a
character's page while somebody is playing on them.

---

## 1.3.1 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Updating a server never picked up changes to the game itself. The source was
  staged once and reused, so the rebuild produced the same binaries and every
  C++ change since the install was dropped. If you updated to 1.3.0 and teleport
  still does not work, update again.

---

## 1.3.0 — 2026-08-10

### Added

- Teleport and running speed work. The helper that carries them out is now
  built and installed with the server.
- Items, yang and levels reach a character who is logged in straight away,
  instead of at their next login.

### Fixed

- On a Linux host the game could start with no quests loaded at all, and still
  report itself healthy. Staged quest files could carry permissions the server
  account could not read.

### Security

- The database function the helper uses accepts only statements against the
  panel's own queue table.

---

## 1.2.3 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- The update command shown in the panel now includes the options the server was
  installed with, such as `--domain` and `--email`. It previously showed the
  bare one-liner, which on the next update would have dropped the certificate.

---

## 1.2.2 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Giving an item, yang or a level to a character who is logged in no longer
  claims they were not in game. It says the change was written to the account
  and appears at their next login.
- Teleport and running speed now say that nothing in the game answered and
  that nothing was changed, instead of suggesting the game server might be
  down.

---

## 1.2.1 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- Removed the paragraph about the deleted `admin` and `test` accounts from the
  panel's introduction.

---

## 1.2.0 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- The patch log splits the changelog at the version you are running: "What an
  update would bring" lists only the releases you do not have yet, and "What
  you are running" the rest. No release appears in both.

---

## 1.1.9 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- The patch log shows the changelog once. When an update was available it was
  printed twice, under two headings, with the same releases in both.

---

## 1.1.8 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- The update page now says to re-run the command that installed the server,
  and what an update leaves alone, instead of explaining a setting that is off.

---

## 1.1.7 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- Removed the heading above the changelog on the patch log page. The file
  brings its own, so there were two.

---

## 1.1.6 — 2026-08-10

### Added

- A "Check for the latest version" button on the patch log page. It asks
  straight away instead of waiting for the daily check.

---

## 1.1.5 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- The installer now ends with the panel address and the game, instead of
  opening with them and scrolling them off the screen.
- A local Windows install no longer prints an admin passphrase. The panel does
  not ask for one there.
- Removed the note about the shipped `admin` and `test` accounts. They are
  deleted during setup.

---

## 1.1.4 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- The Windows installer now updates an existing server as well, and shows the
  installed and published versions before asking. Re-running it previously
  re-applied the settings and restarted without fetching anything.

---

## 1.1.3 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- When a server is already installed, the installer shows which version it is
  on and which one is published, then asks whether to update or to only
  re-apply the settings and restart.
- A server installed before versions existed is recognised as such and offered
  the update.

---

## 1.1.2 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Re-running the installer on a server that was already installed now updates
  it. It used to rewrite the settings and restart the containers without
  fetching anything, so the server stayed on the version it was installed with.

---

## 1.1.1 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- The patch log has its own card in the admin area, with a button. It used to
  be a grey line at the bottom of the page.
- The card highlights itself when a newer version is available.
- The front page shows the version number only. The patch log and the update
  notice are in the admin area.
- Shorter wording when the update check cannot reach the server.

---

## 1.1.0 — 2026-08-09

### Added

- A `VERSION` file and this changelog.
- An update check in the admin panel. It compares your version against the
  published one roughly once a day and tells you when a newer one exists, with
  the release notes for it. Can be switched off with `M2_UPDATE_CHECK=0`.
- A patch-log page in the panel, showing this file.
- The command that updates your server, shown on that page. The installer
  records it, so the panel shows the exact line for your install. Re-running
  the installer pulls the published version, rebuilds and restarts, and keeps
  your database, passwords and settings.
- A one-click update button on Linux. Off by default; see
  [UPDATING.md](UPDATING.md) to turn it on. On Windows the panel shows the
  command to paste instead.

---

## 1.0.0 — 2026-08-09

First public release. A Metin2 r40250 server that runs on ordinary Linux — or
on a Windows PC, for one person — installed with a single command.

### Added

- The Linux port, as a 109 KB patch over 28 files. A fresh copy of the upstream
  package plus this patch reproduces the running server byte for byte.
- Docker packaging: game cores, MariaDB, the admin panel and a client builder,
  in one compose stack.
- One-command installers for Linux and Windows. The Linux one publishes the
  game ports and opens the firewall; the Windows one binds everything to
  `127.0.0.1` and creates no firewall rule.
- The admin panel — English, German and Turkish. Server rates, giving items and
  yang, levels, password-reset links, registration and a client download.
- A client builder that patches the game to point at your server and offers it
  for download. On a Windows install it unpacks the game and puts a
  `Metin2 Singleplayer` shortcut on the Desktop.

### Fixed

- The client download returned 500 on every request. The panel could not create
  the file it counts downloads in.
- The panel showed a running server as offline, and the player count stayed at
  zero.
- "Give 1000 potions" silently gave 255.
- Items were refused to characters that had room for them: the panel searched
  one inventory page of 45 where r40250 gives four.
- The dashboard reported "the database cannot be reached" for a character who
  had never played.
- The game archive was downloaded twice, once for the server and once for the
  client.
- A path containing a space broke the client build.

### Security

- The shipped `admin` and `test` accounts are deleted during setup, together
  with their game-master entry.
- Download limits: three per address per day, plus a server-wide daily ceiling.
- Rate limits on registration, account login and the admin passphrase.
- Passwords are generated on the machine at install time.
