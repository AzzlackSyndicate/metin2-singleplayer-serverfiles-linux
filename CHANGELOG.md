# Changelog

Every release of this project, newest first. The admin panel reads this file to
show you what an update would bring before you install it.

Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **PATCH** — a fix. Nothing you do changes.
- **MINOR** — something new, or something behaves better than it did. Safe to
  take; nothing you have set up stops working.
- **MAJOR** — something you have to act on. A setting that has to move, a
  command that no longer exists, a manual step during the update. These say so
  at the top, in full, before anything else.

Updating never touches your database. Characters, accounts and settings survive
every version here.

## 1.1.2 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Re-running the installer on a server that was already installed now updates
  it. It used to rewrite the settings and restart the containers without
  fetching anything, so the server stayed on the version it was installed with.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- The patch log has its own card in the admin area, with a button. It used to
  be a grey line at the bottom of the page.
- The card highlights itself when a newer version is available.
- The front page shows the version number only. The patch log and the update
  notice are in the admin area.
- Shorter wording when the update check cannot reach the server.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-08-09

### Added

- A `VERSION` file and this changelog.
- An update check in the admin panel. It compares your version against the
  published one roughly once a day and tells you when a newer one exists, with
  the release notes for it. Can be switched off with `M2_UPDATE_CHECK=0`.
- A patch-log page in the panel, showing this file.
- The command that updates your server, shown on that page. The installer
  records it, so the panel shows the exact line for your install. Re-running
  the installer pulls the published version, rebuilds and restarts, and keeps
  your database, passwords and settings.
- A one-click update button on Linux. Off by default; see
  [UPDATING.md](UPDATING.md) to turn it on. On Windows the panel shows the
  command to paste instead.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-08-09

First public release. A Metin2 r40250 server that runs on ordinary Linux — or
on a Windows PC, for one person — installed with a single command.

### Added

- The Linux port, as a 109 KB patch over 28 files. A fresh copy of the upstream
  package plus this patch reproduces the running server byte for byte.
- Docker packaging: game cores, MariaDB, the admin panel and a client builder,
  in one compose stack.
- One-command installers for Linux and Windows. The Linux one publishes the
  game ports and opens the firewall; the Windows one binds everything to
  `127.0.0.1` and creates no firewall rule.
- The admin panel — English, German and Turkish. Server rates, giving items and
  yang, levels, password-reset links, registration and a client download.
- A client builder that patches the game to point at your server and offers it
  for download. On a Windows install it unpacks the game and puts a
  `Metin2 Singleplayer` shortcut on the Desktop.

### Fixed

- The client download returned 500 on every request. The panel could not create
  the file it counts downloads in.
- The panel showed a running server as offline, and the player count stayed at
  zero.
- "Give 1000 potions" silently gave 255.
- Items were refused to characters that had room for them: the panel searched
  one inventory page of 45 where r40250 gives four.
- The dashboard reported "the database cannot be reached" for a character who
  had never played.
- The game archive was downloaded twice, once for the server and once for the
  client.
- A path containing a space broke the client build.

### Security

- The shipped `admin` and `test` accounts are deleted during setup, together
  with their game-master entry.
- Download limits: three per address per day, plus a server-wide daily ceiling.
- Rate limits on registration, account login and the admin passphrase.
- Passwords are generated on the machine at install time.
